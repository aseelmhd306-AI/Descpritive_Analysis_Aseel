# üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project applies machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using a real-world dataset.

## üìÇ Dataset Description
- `step`: Time step (1 step = 1 hour)
- `Amount`: Transaction amount
- `Category`, `Age`, `Gender`: Customer details
- `Fraud`: Target variable (0 = legit, 1 = fraud)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
- Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Evaluation using F1-score and AUC

## üèÜ Best Model
- **Gradient Boosting model ** with F1-score: 91.1% and AUC: 94.7%

## üìå How to Run
1. Open `fraud01.ipynb`
2. Run all cells step-by-step
